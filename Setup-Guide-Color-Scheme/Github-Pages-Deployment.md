<h1 style="text-align:center;">🚀 React and Vite App Deployment with GitHub Pages</h1>

## ✅ **Issue Description**

```
GET https://username.github.io/src/main.jsx net::ERR_ABORTED 404
```

### What this means:

- The `index.html` file is attempting to load `src/main.jsx` directly from the server.
- On **production (GitHub Pages)**, it should reference the **bundled and built files**, rather than the raw `.jsx` files.
- This error typically indicates that the **source code** has been deployed instead of the **compiled files** from the `dist` folder.

---

## ✅ **How to Fix It (Step-by-Step Guide)**

---

### **Step 1: Install `gh-pages`**

The developer should install the `gh-pages` package as a development dependency. Inside the project root directory, they can run:

```bash
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
```

---

### **Step 2: Update `vite.config.js`**

In the `vite.config.js` file, ensure the `base` property correctly points to the GitHub repository name. This is critical for GitHub Pages to resolve paths correctly.

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

export default defineConfig({
  base: "/repository-name/", // 👈 Replace with the repository name!
  plugins: [react()],
});
```

---

### **Step 3: Edit `package.json` Scripts**

In the `package.json` file, add or update the scripts section to include deploy commands. This automates the build and deploy process.

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview",
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
}
```

---

## ✅ **Link the Local Project to GitHub Repository**

---

### **Step 4: Set the Correct Remote Repository**

The developer should verify and set the GitHub remote URL using:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
```

They can confirm it with:

```bash
git remote -v
```

Expected output:

```
origin  https://github.com/username/repository-name.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/username/repository-name.git (push)
```

---

### **Step 5: Commit and Push the Code**

If there are changes in the local project, the developer should commit and push them to GitHub using:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Updated site for gh-pages deployment"
git push origin main
```

_(Replace `main` with the appropriate branch name if necessary)_

---

## ✅ **Deploy to GitHub Pages**

---

### **Step 6: Ensure Correct Deployment Settings**

#### a) Inside `package.json`:

Make sure the `deploy` script explicitly points to the repository:

```json
"deploy": "gh-pages -d dist -r https://github.com/username/repository-name.git"
```

#### b) Or run the deploy command manually:

```bash
npx gh-pages -d dist -r https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
```

---

### **Step 7: Deploy the Project**

The developer can now deploy the project by running:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

✅ What happens during deployment:

- The app is built into the `/dist` folder.
- The contents of `dist` are pushed to the `gh-pages` branch.
- GitHub Pages serves the **built files**, not the raw source files.

---

## ✅ **Configure GitHub Pages Settings**

---

### **Step 8: Select Deployment Source in GitHub**

1. Go to the repository:  
   👉 `https://github.com/username/repository-name`
2. Navigate to:  
   **Settings → Pages**
3. Under **Source**:
   - Select **Branch**: `gh-pages`
   - Select **Folder**: `/ (root)`

---

### **Step 9: Access the Live Site**

After ~1 minute, the deployed website should be live at:  
👉 `https://username.github.io/repository-name/`

---

## ✅ **Recap of the Deployment Process**

### 🔹 **What was wrong?**

The project was referencing `src/main.jsx`, which doesn't exist in the production build. GitHub Pages serves from `/dist/index.html` and requires compiled, bundled files.

### 🔹 **What was done?**

- The app was built using `vite build`.
- The `/dist` folder was deployed with `gh-pages`.

## ✅ **What Not to Do**

| ❌ Don'ts                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ Don't deploy raw `src` files to GitHub Pages    |
| ❌ Don't manually upload files to GitHub Pages     |
| ❌ Don't serve `main.jsx`—use the **built** files! |

---

## ✅ **Quick Commands Summary**

| Action         | Command                                             |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Install        | `npm install gh-pages --save-dev`                   |
| Build          | `npm run build`                                     |
| Build & Deploy | `npm run deploy`                                    |
| GitHub Pages   | Configure GitHub Pages to use the `gh-pages` branch |

---

## ✅ **Important Note for Next Time**

For every new deployment, the developer should follow these two key steps:

1. **Run the build command**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This creates the latest production-ready files inside the `/dist` folder.

2. **Deploy the built files**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```
   This pushes the `/dist` contents to the `gh-pages` branch.

---

## ✅ **Final Result**

👉 After following all steps correctly, the website will be successfully live at:  
`https://username.github.io/repository-name/`
